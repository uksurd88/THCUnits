# THC Units Calculator

A simple, harm-reduction–focused web app that converts cannabis amount (grams) and potency (% THC) into **standard THC units**, similar to how alcohol consumption is measured using standard drinks.

The calculator is based on recent public-health research proposing **1 THC unit = 5 mg of pure THC**, helping users better understand potency-adjusted cannabis exposure rather than relying on weight or frequency alone.

## Why this matters

- Cannabis potency varies widely; grams alone are misleading  
- High-THC products are linked to increased risk of cannabis use disorder  
- Standardized units enable clearer self-monitoring and public-health guidance  

## Features

- Instant calculation of THC units from grams and THC %  
- Displays total milligrams of THC  
- Includes evidence-based guideline: **≤ 8 THC units per week** for lower risk  
- Clean, mobile-friendly, privacy-respecting (no data collection)  
- Runs entirely in the browser (HTML/CSS/JS)  

## Intended use

This tool is designed for **education and harm reduction**, not medical diagnosis.  
The safest level of cannabis use is no use; this app supports informed decision-making for those who choose to consume.
